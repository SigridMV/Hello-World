# Overview

As a software engineer, I am always looking for ways to learn and improve. This project is a way to get better at using tools like Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub and Python together. ðŸ’»âœ¨

This is a simple 'Hello World' program, showing how these tools can work together in a basic setup.

I created it to improve my coding skills, version control and use of development environments. It's also a step towards becoming better at code management and collaborating with others.
